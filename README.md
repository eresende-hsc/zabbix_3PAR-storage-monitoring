# zabbix_3PAR-storage-monitoring ( forked )
# Introduction
This repository is a fork of [zabbix_3PAR-storage-monitoring](https://github.com/hvaithia/zabbix_3PAR-storage-monitoring/tree/master).  

Here I did some fixes and improviments.
 - Enable support of SSD disks type
 - Create trigger for NL and SSD capacity
 - Fix the conditional rule when there is no disks in NL, FC or SSD.
 - Fix the limitation of InServ when it `doesn´t support ssh connection with keys` and You can´t install the `3par CLI`,  
   but You will need to install a package in your linux box.

# Responsability
You can use it, `at your risk`... feel free for copy and edit it.

# Original README Content ( fixed )
The script is the same which is used in Nagios for 3PAR monitoring with some changes here and there  
You need to put the test3par.sh bash script in the "externalscripts" directory defined in zabbix_server.conf  
For the template to work you need to have read only access - user account to the 3PAR command line  
You must also make the zabbix user as onw which runs bash as default instead of a nologin acc  

For this do the following pre-reqs below,
- make a copy of /etc/passwd as "root" user  
- edit the /etc/passwd to reflect like below,  
		zabbix:x:498:497:Zabbix Monitoring System:/var/lib/zabbix:/bin/bash - (Earlier it will be /sbin/nologin)  
- create a password for the zabbix user (passwd zabbix)  
- create a directory (mkdir /var/lib/zabbix/) and the directory should be owned by zabbix user  
- chown zabbix /var/lib/zabbix/  

Once this is done you will need to login to the zabbix server as a zabbix user and the password you just created  
Now you need to create a public-private keypair in zabbix server and then copy the public key to 3par machine for authentication  
This will ensure that the zabbix need not enter passwd to ssh and run the commands to get 3par storage status  

From zabbix server do,  
- ssh-keygen and then press enter  
- This will create the private key in /var/lib/zabbix/.ssh/id_rsa  
- The public key will be in /var/lib/zabbix/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  
- Copy the contents of 3PAR id_rsa.pub. You need to use it in 3PAR for auth  

Login to the 3PAR command line (You should have an user with read only access to 3par cli)  

Do the following below in 3PAR CLI  
- ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
- Paste the contents of the id_rsa.pub here and then press enter  
- The public key of zabbix server is added to 3PAR - This means that we do not need to authenticate when we ssh as
   ssh 3paruser@3parip from zabbix server as a zabbix user    
   If you have any doubts aboutthis, please refer  
	http://exchange.nagios.org/components/com_mtree/attachment.php?link_id=2610&cf_id=29  
- Inside the test3par.sh script change the username to 3PAR user name of your environment

After all the changes import the template and then assign the 3PAR storage you discover to that template

Keep the "Timeout" in zabbix_server.conf sufficiently high. Max 30 secs. This ll ensure the script execution doesn't timeout

There are 9 items and 18 triggers in this template for monitoring
